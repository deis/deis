Container
=========

You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind.
Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the
avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and
only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said
we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.

Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also
clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We
swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However
unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just
on opposite ends.
