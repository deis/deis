Chef Node
=========

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped
to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a
blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that
shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy
store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes
sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to
be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like
you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of
the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
