Community
=========

Deis is a fully open source project. As such, the "Deis community" consists
of anyone who uses the Deis software and participates in its evolution,
whether by answering questions, finding bugs, suggesting enhancements, or
writing documentation or code.

Deis development is coordinated through its project `on GitHub`_. Anyone can
check out the source code for Deis, fork the project, make improvements,
and create a pull request to incorporate those changes into Deis.

`OpDemand`_ maintains the Deis project, and as such has final say over what
ends up in the official GitHub repository for Deis. Deis depends on the
contributions of the community; the maintainers will not ignore pull
requests or issues.

Conduct
=======

The deis community welcomes and encourages participation by **everyone**.

No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome
you. We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they interact
constructively with our community.

The deis developer community continues to grow, and it is inevitable that
disagreements and conflict will arise. We ask that participants conduct
themselves according to these principles:

- **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**

- **Be considerate.**

  Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on
  the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
  colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
  making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you
  might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.

- **Be respectful.**

  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse
  for poor behavior and bad manners. We might all experience some
  frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn
  into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community
  where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

- **Be careful in the words that you choose.**

  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants.
  Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
  exclusionary jokes are never appropriate for the community.
