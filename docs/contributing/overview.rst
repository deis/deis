Contributor Overview
====================

Interested in contributing to the Deis project?  There are lots of ways to help.

File Bugs & Enhancements
------------------------
Find a bug? Want to see a new feature? Have a request
for the maintainers? Open a `GitHub issue`_ and we’ll get the conversation
started.

Write Documentation
-------------------
We are always looking to improve and expand our
documentation. Most docs reside in the main repository under the `docs/`_
directory. Simply fork the project, update docs and send us a pull request.

Enhance Chef Integration
------------------------
We want Chef users to feel at home using Deis. Got an
idea for improving our Chef integration? Have some thoughts on making the
`deis-cookbook`_ more reusable? Open a `GitHub issue`_ and let us know!

Add New Cloud Providers
-----------------------
Want to see Deis extended to a new cloud provider? Go
for it! Adding new providers is easy. Just follow the `EC2 example`_ and make
sure you provide test coverage in your pull request.

Improve Deis Core
-----------------
Deis core is a Django/Celery application with a Python CLI.
We are always looking for help improving the core framework, tooling and test
coverage. Interested in contributing to Deis core? Let’s chat in IRC.
