# Deis Contrib

Scripts, tools and documentation that are not part of the core
Deis system.

The contents of this directory may be vendor-specific, address a
limited audience, or be too experimental to be included in Deis' core.
This does not preclude their usefulness.

Please add any issues you find with this software to the
[Deis project](https://github.com/opdemand/deis/issues).
