# Deis Contrib

Scripts, tools and documentation that are not part of the core
Deis system.

limited audience, or be too experimental to be included in Deis' core.
This does not preclude their usefulness.

Please add any issues you find with this software to the
[Deis project](https://github.com/deis/deis/issues).
